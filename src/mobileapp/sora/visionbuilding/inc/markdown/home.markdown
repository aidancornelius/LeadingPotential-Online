## Home Page Markdown

This is the home page of the Generative Leadership Project.

The cool news is we can write in markdown and pure php/html.

So buttons for example, we can do nifty things with.

DON'T WORRY! Not all pages are Markdown, but anything that's NOT defined as a programmed page (AKA survey) will go looking for a markdown file. If it doesn't find one then it'll 404.
